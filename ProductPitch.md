# First Steps
---

## **Step 1: Define MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)**

Focus only on the **must-have core features** that deliver real value and are quick to build.

### MVP Feature Set:

* [ ] Agent CRM: Add/view leads, move leads through stages
* [ ] Open House Sign-In: QR check-in + contact capture
* [ ] AI Listing Generator: Text generation for MLS + social
* [ ] Contract Wizard: Pre-filled PDF template from lead data

> Don’t build user registration/login until features work—start with hardcoded users during dev.

---

## **Step 2: Design Your Data Models (Backend-First)**

Use Django to model:

### Key Models:

* `Agent`
* `Lead`
* `Listing` (connected to Lead or stand-alone)
* `OpenHouseEvent` + `OpenHouseCheckIn`
* `DocumentTemplate`
* `GeneratedDocument`
* `MessageLog` (for SMS/Email tracking)

Would you like a full ER diagram or model definitions next?

---

## **Step 3: Build the Backend API**

Start with Django REST Framework:

* Create serializers and viewsets for the above models
* Use `django-cors-headers` for cross-origin support
* Add simple token auth (can switch to JWT later)

> Use [Django Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/admin/) to seed test data while you build.

---

## **Step 4: Build a React Frontend**

Start with:

* Basic dashboard layout (Sidebar + Topbar)
* Views: Leads List, Lead Details, AI Generator, Document Wizard
* Forms to add leads + generate listings
* Hook up OpenAI and test a prompt flow

Use Vite + TypeScript to scaffold it out quickly.

---

## **Step 5: Integrate OpenAI for Listing Descriptions**

* Use a simple endpoint:
  `POST /api/generate-listing/`
  with body: `{ address, features, square_footage, style }`
* Prompt it to generate MLS and Instagram blurbs
* Return text to frontend and allow user to copy/save

---

## **Step 6: Add Document Auto-Fill Wizard**

* Use a PDF template (can be static to start)
* Fill fields with lead + property info (use `pdfrw` or `pdf-lib`)
* Generate and download/send signed docs

Later, integrate e-signature APIs like SignWell or DocuSign.

---

## **Step 7: Polish, Deploy, and Share**

* Deploy backend (Railway, Fly.io, or Render)
* Frontend on Vercel or Netlify
* Use Supabase or AWS for file storage

> Then share with a few real estate agents for feedback.

### **Where to Start First?**

If you're building **solo**, here's the recommended initial order:

1. **Set up Django backend with Leads + CRM API**
2. **Build React UI to add/view leads and move through stages**
3. **Integrate OpenAI to test listing description generation**
4. **Build Open House QR sign-in flow**
5. **Tackle document generation last** (PDF + contract template handling)

---

Let me know if you want:

* Database model code to start with
* OpenAI prompt suggestions for the generator
* UI wireframes for the dashboard or contract flow
* A GitHub project layout with backend + frontend folders

Where would you like to go next?
